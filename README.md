## A search tool on [btso.pw](https://btso.pw)

A python clean interface to download p2p sharing stuff with magnet links.

### To-dos:

- Provide options to get a few mag links corresponding to torrent.
- Provide a better interface. Users can input their search string in CLI.
- Better output by accessing more (all) pages.
- Provide a summary of the movie from [avso.pw](www.avso.pw) (giving a link to the movie or maybe something better, not sure).
  - If providing screenshots there will be more work. For example, displaying screenshots will require a graphic interface.
  - Maybe include actor stats and photo and relevant actors?
