## A search tool on [btso.pw](https://btso.pw)

A python clean interface to download p2p sharing stuff with magnet links.

Well, I feel this will be more interesting. Seeing more possibilities with it. Gonna put more work in it.

### To-dos:
- [x] Mac build works.
- [ ] Provide options to get a few mag links corresponding to torrent.
- [ ] Provide a better interface. Users can input their search string in CLI.
- [ ] Better output by accessing more (all) pages.
- [ ] Provide a summary of the movie from [avso.pw](www.avso.pw) (giving a link to the movie or maybe something better, not sure).
  - If providing screenshots there will be more work. For example, displaying screenshots will require a graphic interface.
  - Maybe include actor stats and photo and relevant actors?
- [ ]**Cross-platform build is not easy.** But `pyinstaller` do build on all platforms just have to build again in windows/linux to distribute versions.
- [ ] Windows build.
