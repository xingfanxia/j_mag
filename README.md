## A search tool on [btso.pw](https://btso.pw)

A python clean interface to download p2p sharing stuff with magnet links.

Well, I feel this will be more interesting. Seeing more possibilities with it. Gonna put more work in it.

### To-dos:
- [x] Mac build works.
- [x] Provide options to get a few mag links corresponding to torrent.
- [x] Provide a better interface. Users can input their search string in CLI.
- [x] Better output by accessing more (all) pages. Now users can specify how many pages of result they want to see.
- [ ] Provide a summary of the movie from `avso.pw` (giving a link to the movie or maybe something better, not sure).
    - If providing screenshots there will be more work. For example, displaying screenshots will require a graphic interface.
    - Maybe include actor stats and photo and relevant actors?
    - If query is a actor name: provide actor stats and relevant actors
    - If query is a movie: provide a list of actors and their stats
- [ ] **Cross-platform build is not easy.** But `pyinstaller` do build on all platforms just have to build again in windows/linux to distribute versions. Tried to build on windows, but cross-language compatibility is hard to achieve on windows. Windows' shell(cmd) or powershell cannot display languages other than the system default language properly.
